## Usage Examples

### Generate Referral Code

```bash
POST /referrals/code
Authorization: Bearer <token>

Response:
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "code": "ABC12345",
  "userId": "user-uuid",
  "totalReferrals": 0,
  "activeReferrals": 0,
  "totalRewardsEarned": 0,
  "isActive": true,
  "createdAt": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

### Get Invite Link

```bash
GET /referrals/invite-link
Authorization: Bearer <token>

Response:
{
  "inviteLink": "http://localhost:3000/signup?ref=ABC12345"
}
```

### Use Referral Code

```bash
POST /referrals/use
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "code": "ABC12345",
  "source": "email",
  "campaign": "winter2025"
}

Response:
{
  "id": "referral-uuid",
  "referrerId": "referrer-uuid",
  "refereeId": "referee-uuid",
  "status": "pending",
  "referrerReward": 100,
  "refereeReward": 50,
  "createdAt": "2025-01-01T00:00:00Z"
}
```

### Get Leaderboard

```bash
GET /referrals/leaderboard/all?type=total_referrals&limit=10&offset=0

Response:
{
  "entries": [
    {
      "userId": "uuid",
      "username": "player1",
      "code": "ABC12345",
      "totalReferrals": 50,
      "activeReferrals": 10,
      "completedReferrals": 40,
      "totalRewardsEarned": 4000,
      "rank": 1
    }
  ],
  "total": 100,
  "type": "total_referrals"
}
```

## Reward System

### Default Rewards

- **Referrer Reward**: 100 points (configurable)
- **Referee Reward**: 50 points (configurable)

### Reward Distribution

Rewards are distributed when a referral is marked as completed. Currently, rewards are added to the user's experience and total score. In production, this should integrate with the economy-service microservice.

## Migration

To apply the database migration:

```bash
npm run build
npx typeorm migration:run -d dist/config/orm-config.js
```

The migration file is located at: `src/migrations/CreateReferralTables.ts`

## Integration

The referral module is automatically integrated into the main application via `app.module.ts`. It requires:

- TypeORM with PostgreSQL
- User entity from `users` module
- JWT authentication (for protected endpoints)

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Integration with economy-service for reward distribution
- [ ] Email notifications for referral events
- [ ] Referral code expiration and renewal
- [ ] Multi-tier referral system
- [ ] Referral code customization
- [ ] Fraud detection and prevention
- [ ] Referral code analytics per campaign

## Acceptance Criteria Status

✅ **Unique referral codes generated per player** - Implemented with unique code generation  
✅ **Referrals tracked accurately** - Complete tracking with status management  
✅ **Rewards distributed to both referrer and referee** - Reward distribution implemented  
✅ **Referral metrics accessible** - Analytics dashboard and endpoints available
